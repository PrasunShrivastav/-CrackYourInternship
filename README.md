# -CrackYourInternship
I'm excited to announce that I'm starting a 45-day coding challenge called #CrackYourInternship! This challenge is designed to help aspiring interns like myself sharpen their programming skills and prepare for internship interviews.

What's involved?

Daily coding problems: We'll be tackling a new coding problem every day, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts that are frequently tested in interviews.

Language agnostic: Feel free to use your preferred programming language! The focus is on problem-solving and understanding the logic behind the code.

Community support: We'll be creating a space (mention platform like Discord or discussion forum) to discuss approaches, share solutions, and learn from each other.
